    "desc": "Goal to determine how well cloud types natively emerge from minimally-processed GOES-16 channels. Develop an image-to-image convolutional autoencoder using distributed PyTorch to learn salient features that are clustered with k-means. Inferred and visible channels perform best for separating clear and cloudy conditions and detecting icing.",

    "desc": "Display how hardware defects and image capture techniques influence performance of artificial neural networks. Propose training solutions that enhance a models ability to generalize and improve robustness against alterations. Results yield a best-case improvement of 80% and accuracies within 3% of the natural model for all perturbations.",
