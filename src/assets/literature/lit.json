    "title": "Memory-Based Sequential Attention",
    "abstract": "Computational models of sequential attention often use recurrent neural networks, which may lead to information loss over accumulated glimpses and an inability to dynamically reweigh glimpses at each step. Addressing the former limitation should result in greater performance, while addressing the latter should enable greater interpretability. In this work, we propose a biologically-inspired model of sequential attention for image classification. Specifically, our algorithm contextualizes the history of observed locations from within an image to inform future gaze points, akin to scanpaths in the biological visual system. We achieve this by using a transformer-based memory module coupled with a reinforcement learning-based learning algorithm, improving both task performance and model interpretability. In addition to empirically evaluating our approach on classical vision tasks, we demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm to different initial locations in the image and provide interpretations of sampled locations from within the trajectory.",

    "title": "Exploring the Use of Machine Learning to Improve Vertical Profiles of Temperature and Moisture",
    "abstract": "Vertical profiles of temperature and dewpoint are useful in predicting deep convection that leads to severe weather which threatens property and lives. Currently, forecasters rely on observations from radiosonde launches and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Radiosonde observations are, however, temporally and spatially sparse, and NWP models contain inherent errors that influence short-term predictions of high impact events. This work explores using machine learning (ML) to postprocess NWP model forecasts, combining them with satellite data to improve vertical profiles of temperature and dewpoint. We focus on different ML architectures, loss functions, and input features to optimize predictions. Because we are predicting vertical profiles at 256 levels in the atmosphere, this work provides a unique perspective at using ML for 1-D tasks. Compared to baseline profiles from the Rapid Refresh (RAP), ML predictions offer the largest improvement for dewpoint, particularly in the mid- and upper-atmosphere. Temperature improvements are modest, but CAPE values are improved by up to 40%. Feature importance analyses indicate that the ML models are primarily improving incoming RAP biases. While additional model and satellite data offer some improvement to the predictions, architecture choice is more important than feature selection in fine-tuning the results. Our proposed deep residual UNet performs the best by leveraging spatial context from the input RAP profiles; however, the results are remarkably robust across model architecture. Further, uncertainty estimates for every level are well-calibrated and can provide useful information to forecasters.",

    "title": "Attention-Based Scattering Network for Satellite Imagery",
    "abstract": "Multi-channel satellite imagery, from stacked spectral bands or spatiotemporal data, have meaningful representations for various atmospheric properties. Combining these features in an effective manner to create a performant and trustworthy model is of utmost importance to forecasters. Neural networks show promise, yet suffer from unintuitive computations, fusion of high-level features, and may be limited by the quantity of available data. In this work, we leverage the scattering transform to extract high-level features without additional trainable parameters and introduce a separation scheme to bring attention to independent input channels. Experiments show promising results on estimating tropical cyclone intensity and predicting the occurrence of lightning from satellite imagery.",

    "title": "An Interpretable Model of Climate Change Using Correlative Learning",
    "abstract": "Determining changes in global temperature and precipitation that may indicate climate change is complicated by annual variations. One approach for finding potential climate change indicators is to train a model that predicts the year from annual means of global temperatures and precipitations. Such data is available from the CMIP6 ensemble of simulations. Here a two-hidden-layer neural network trained on this data successfully predicts the year. Differences among temperature and precipitation patterns for which the model predicts specific years reveal changes through time. To find these optimal patterns, a new way of interpreting what the neural network has learned is explored. Alopex, a stochastic correlative learning algorithm, is used to find optimal temperature and precipitation maps that best predict a given year. These maps are compared over multiple years to show how temperature and precipitations patterns indicative of each year change over time.",

The network uses a wavelet transform as the first layer of a neural network where the convolution is a parameterized function of the complex Morlet wavelet.

Research in the deep learning field is very actively pursuing new methods to interpret deep neural networks and to reduce their complexity.

An application is shown in which models that map global temperature and precipitation to years are trained to investigate patterns associated with changes in climate.",

Furthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function, and it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental science applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized. Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental sciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their own custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic performance measures already developed in environmental science, including...",
